In 1996 R. Quinlan introduced the M5 algorithm, a regression tree algorithm similar to CART (Breiman), with additional pruning so that leaves may contain linear models instead of constant values. The idea was to get smoother and simpler models.

The algorithm was later enhanced by Wang & Witten under the name M5 Prime (aka M5', or M5P), with an implementation in the Weka toolbox.

`m5py` is a python implementation leveraging `scikit-learn`'s regression tree engine.
